#**EDA Using Univariate Analysis**

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to perform univariate analysis as part of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
The analysis focuses on understanding the distribution and properties of individual variables in a dataset, specifically:

Numerical variables (e.g., Age, Fare)
Categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked)

**Project Overview**
This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to performing univariate analysis on a dataset. The key components include:

Data loading and inspection: Loading the dataset and performing an initial exploration of its structure.
Statistical summary of numerical variables: Using methods like .min(), .max(), .mean(), and .skew() to calculate descriptive statistics.
Visualizing distributions: Creating histograms and boxplots to understand the distribution of numerical data.
Categorical variable analysis: Counting unique values and plotting the distribution of categorical variables.

**Key Features:**
Descriptive statistics for numerical variables (e.g., mean, skewness)
Handling missing data
Visualization of distributions using histograms and boxplots
Frequency analysis for categorical variables

**Requirements**
To run this notebook, you will need:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn

**images**
In the images Iâ€™ve uploaded, there are two examples demonstrating the capabilities of computer vision.
The first image showcases computer vision in action, detecting various objects in a public space.
